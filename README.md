# Sudoku-Solver

### How it works

`sudoku = Sudoku.new`
`sudoku.set_game("800000000003600000070090200050007000000045700000100030001000068008500010090000400")`
`sudoku.solve`

The solver can also read strings that are seperated by periods. 

###Todo:
Run tests with the solver for all these puzzles: http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/python/sudoku/
Make a new rails app for it?
